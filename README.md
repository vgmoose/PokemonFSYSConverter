## PokemonFSYSConverter
This is a program to extract .obm and textures out of .fsys files, such as the ones found in Pok√©mon Battle Revolution. It is a modified fork of [the original](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-22105.html) by ImaginaryZ.

### Usage
Place .fsys files in `./files/`, and run the executable:
```
./PokemonFSYSConverter
```

.fsys files can be extracted from a disk image using [Wiimms](http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Wiimms_ISO_Tools#Extracting_file)

### Changes from Original
The program is now compatible with unix operating systems
